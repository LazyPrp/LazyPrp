- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was actually a real bug! In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found a moth causing problems in the machine. They "debugged" the computer by removing the moth and taped it into the logbook with the note, “First actual case of bug being found.” So, if you’ve ever had issues with your computer, you can thank that moth for starting it all! 🦋
